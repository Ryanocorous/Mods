# Mod descriptions 

## IB_EFFECTS (In battle effects) 

The aim of this mod is to make a nuzlocke run much harder. The rules are simple. You are allowed to use items in the nuzlocke run, however these items have been greatly nerfed.

Changes:

1) All potions now heal much less than before. There is no full restore.
2) All items that remove status effects now cause you to take some damage.
3) Revive and max revived is nerfed.
4) Other effects that will catch you off guard :)
